    <h1> The best pizza recipe </h1>
    <img src="../images/slikapice.jpeg">

    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.

    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> flour</li>
        <li>tomato</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li> ham</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
    
        <li> “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.</li>
        <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</li>
    </ol>
